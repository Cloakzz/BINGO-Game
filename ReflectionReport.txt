DESIGNING THE PROGRAM:

The CARD class was used for OPTION 3 (Generate Card(s)). The PLAYER class was used in
both OPTION 4 (Create Virtual Players) and OPTION 5 (BINGO CALLER). The CALLER class 
was used in OPTION 5 (BINGO CALLER).

At first, I used the data members and member functions from Assignment 2 (Documentation).
However, although they made sense, using them together did not work. Thus, I made major 
changes to the data members and member functions of the classes. 



IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM:

Implementing the program was like a walk in the park. I had no problems writing the code 
for the compulsory options. However, things changed when I designed OPTION 6 (THE BINGO 
GAME). I immediately wrote the member functions without any planning and in the middle of
designing it, I realized a problem. Thus, I have to do it from scratch and plan first.
After planning it, I was able to implement the BINGO game successfully. 



IMPROVEMENTS THAT I WOULD DO:

From this experience, I learned that planning is the most crucial step in designing a
program. With strong planning, the execution will be fast and more or less perfect.

If I were to work on this project again, I would spend most of my time planning until
everything is working according to theory and hypothesis. I would also try to make 
functions for processes that are going to be reused a lot of times (Such as checking 
for repeating numbers) 



EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES THAT I DID:

- Having at least 1 extra class in the game.
- Display the word Bingo using ASCII art when a player wins.
- Allow the Bingo Caller data to be saved and restored at the user's request.
- Allow the player to select which elements to use (X / O).
- Display the final called numbers with their prefix letter (B, I, N, G, O).
